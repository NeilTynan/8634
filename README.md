# Principles of Data Analytics Project Repository

This README has been written with [GitHub's documentation on README's] (https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind.

## About this Project

This notebook contains my analysis of the famous [Palmer Penguins dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). The work here is related to my assignment for module 8634 -- PRINCIPLES OF DATA ANALYTICS and, consequently, will be focused around the objectives of the assignment.

In line with the assessment guide for this course, this project intends to:
1. Source and investigate the Palmer Penguin (PP) dataset.
2. Programmatically explore and visualize the data in it.
3. Identify the types of variables in the dataset and determining which ones might be suitable for analysis.
4. Create a bar chart of approapriate variables in the dataset 
5. Select two variables from the data set and provide an analysis of how correlated they are.


## Use of this Project

This repository may be of some interest to other students engaged in similar projects around the PalmerPenguins dataset. Feel free to use whatever you like from it (though if another party has been referenced, I would ask that you likewise cite them).

The workbook has a Google collab page, which is freely accessible for all interested parties.

## Getting Started

The workbook is structured in a linear fashion, so reading through it from start to finish is the best approach. You may benefit from reading about the PalmerPenguins dataset first but the workbook does attempt to provide an overview of the relevant points.

To understand how the workbook has developped to date, please see below a timeline of the work done on the notebook and the material referenced in the course of this work:
